# Rules

## Starting

Every player gets 1000 coins and 2 **Forest Tokens**.
Every time a player passes the starting point, they can get 200 coins and 1 **Forest Token**.

## 1. Natural vs. Non-Natural Places

- Natural Places:
  - Owning **Natural Places** gives you **Forest Tokens** when certain conditions are met (e.g., landing on them, passing through, or drawing a relevant card).
  - No building allowed: These locations remain pure, in line with their natural theme.
  - Rewards: Each natural place can grant 1 **Forest Token** to the owner when visited by other players. Or (50 coins, 100 coins, 150 coins, 200 coins according to the side).
  - Players earn a **Forest Token** only when stepping on owned **Natural Places**, not when they purchase one.
- Non-Natural Places:
  - Work like traditional Monopoly properties. Players can build houses (or thematic alternatives like cabins) on these locations to collect rent.
  - Players need to own all spaces in the same label (natural vs. non-natural) group to build (similar to traditional rules)
  - Goal: These places represent community structures, so they are associated with earning money rather than **Forest Tokens**.

## 2. Forest Tokens

- Purpose: An alternative currency used for special actions like summoning the Catbus, avoiding penalties, or advancing towards victory.
- Earning Forest Tokens:
  - Landing on **Natural Places** (owned or unowned) grants 1 **Forest Token**.
    - When another player lands on a **Natural Place** that you own, you gain 1 **Forest Token** (instead of rent).
    - If the space is unowned, the player earns 1 **Forest Token** directly.
  - Completing certain challenges or drawing specific cards rewards **Forest Tokens**.
  - Trading money for **Forest Tokens** is allowed. To prevent exploitation, no reverse exchange (**Forest Tokens** back to coins) is allowed.
- Using Forest Tokens:
  - Summon the Catbus: Spend 2 **Forest Tokens** to teleport to any Bus Stop.
  - Avoid penalties: Pay 1 **Forest Token** to ignore weather effects or certain rent fees.
  - Totoro Tree Access: Need 10 **Forest Tokens** to approach Totoro’s Tree and fulfill the final condition for winning.
  - Pay Forest Management Fees (Taxes): Players can choose to pay taxes in **Forest Tokens** instead of coins, offering an alternative that preserves their wealth.

## 3. Bus Stops and Weather Effects

- Bus Stops:
  - Players can buy Bus Stops to earn “transport fees” when other players land on them (similar to railroads). Owning multiple Bus Stops increases fees.
  - Transport Fee: Players landing on a Bus Stop must pay a transport fee to the owner:
    - 1 stop owned: Pay 25 coins.
    - 2 stops owned: Pay 50 coins.
    - 3 stops owned: Pay 100 coins.
    - 4 stops owned: Pay 200 coins.
  - Owners of all 4 Bus Stops can use the Catbus for free during their turn, bypassing the regular transport fee.
- Catbus Travel:
  - Players can summon the Catbus by spending 2 **Forest Tokens**.
  - The Catbus allows you to travel to any Bus Stop or the Totoro tree (if you claim you want to win through the **Forest Tokens** goal).
  - You can use Catbus travel to escape from fine.
- Weather Effects:
  - Weather changes every 3 turns (tracked using a small **Forest Token** on the board).
  - Rainy Weather:
    - ~~Rent on Bus Stops doubles. Too powerful~~
    - Catbus becomes unavailable for travel.
  - Sunny Weather:
    - Normal gameplay; Catbus operates as usual.

## 4. Dust Sprite Activities

- Dust Sprite Spaces:
  - Draw a Special Dust Sprite Card
  - Alternatively, they can trade coins for **Forest Tokens** at a favorable exchange rate (e.g., 25 coins = 1 **Forest Token**).

## 5. Utilities

- "Dust Sprite Coal Delivery" Cost: 150 coins.
  - If a "not owner" lands here they can either:
    1. Pay the rent (4x or 10x dice roll if both utilities are owned).
    2. Trade one **Forest Token** (if they have any) to avoid paying rent, gaining favor with the Dust Sprites. (50:1 ratio)
        - If this trade is done, the owner receives 1 **Forest Token** per **Forest Token** trade (one-time for one place & person bonus), alternatively the owner earns 20 coins per natural property they own (one-time for one place & person bonus). Example: If the owner has 3 natural properties, they earn 60 coins per **Forest Token** traded.
        - it means if one day the owner sells it, another player who buys it can again get this bonus.
  - Punishment Interaction:
    - During Rainy Weather, landing on this utility results in an extra 10% rent, at least 10, due to slippery coal paths.

## 6. Final Winning Condition

There are two possible victory conditions:

### 1. Forest Tokens Goal

To win, players must reach Totoro’s Tree by fulfilling one of two paths:

- a) The Hidden Path
  - Requirements
    - Collect 10 **Forest Tokens**.
    - Obtain the “Dust Sprite’s Help” card
  - Steps
    - Once you have 10 **Forest Tokens** and the “Dust Sprite’s Help” card, announce you’re aiming for Totoro’s Tree.
    - After declaring:
      - You cannot buy properties or collect **Forest Tokens** intentionally (e.g., trading, purchasing).
      - You can still gain **Forest Tokens** by:
        - Landing on **Natural Places**.
        - Drawing Chance Cards that grant **Forest Tokens**.
    - Journey to Totoro’s Tree:
      - You must land on Hidden Path first.
      - Move to Totoro’s Tree to win.
- b) The Catbus drive
  - Requirements
    - Collect 10 **Forest Tokens**.
    - Obtain the Umbrella Tool
  - Steps
    - Land on any Bus Stop and announce you’re "waiting for Big Totoro"
    - Move to Totoro’s tree to win.

Interruption Rules (Shared for Both Paths) \
Players can disrupt a declared victory attempt in two ways:

  1. Steal **Forest Tokens**:
      - If a claimant is on the **Forest Tokens** Path, opponents can steal 1 **Forest Token** by landing on their properties.
      - If the claimant drops below 10 **Forest Tokens**, they must recover to 10 before reaching Totoro’s Tree.
  2. Block the Tree:
      - If any player reaches Totoro’s Tree before the claimant, the claimant’s attempt fails:
          - **Forest Tokens** Path: Lose 2 **Forest Tokens** and restart.
  3. Sabotage Declarations:
      - Opponents can use cards to cancel a declaration (e.g., “Rainstorm” cancels the Umbrella attempt).

### 2. Traditional Wealth Goal

If one player bankrupts all others, they win as in classic Monopoly.
