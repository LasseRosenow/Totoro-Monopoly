# Rules

## Starting

Every player gets 1000 coins and 2 forest tokens.
Every time a player passes the starting point, they can get 200 coins and 1 forest token.

## 1. Natural vs. Non-Natural Places

- Natural Places:
  - Owning these places gives you forest tokens when certain conditions are met (e.g., landing on them, passing through, or drawing a relevant card).
  - No building allowed: These locations remain pure, in line with their natural theme.
  - Rewards: Each natural place can grant 1 forest token when landed on by other players. Or (50 coins, 100 coins, 150 coins, 200 coins according to the side).
  - Players earn a Forest Token only when stepping on owned natural places, not when they purchase one.
- Non-Natural Places:
  - Work like traditional Monopoly properties. Players can build houses (or thematic alternatives like cabins) on these locations to collect rent.
  - Players need to own all spaces in the same label (natural vs. non-natural) group to build (similar to traditional rules)
  - Goal: These places represent community structures, so they are associated with earning money rather than forest tokens.

## 2. Forest Tokens

- Purpose: An alternative currency used for special actions like summoning the Catbus, avoiding penalties, or advancing towards victory.
- Earning Forest Tokens:
  - Landing on natural places (owned or unowned) grants 1 token.
    - When another player lands on a natural place that you own, you gain 1 forest token (instead of rent).
    - If the space is unowned, the player earns 1 forest token directly.
  - Completing certain challenges or drawing specific cards rewards tokens.
  - Trading money for tokens is allowed. To prevent exploitation, no reverse exchange (tokens back to coins) is allowed.
- Using Forest Tokens:
  - Summon the Catbus: Spend 2 tokens to teleport to any Bus Stop.
  - Avoid penalties: Pay 1 token to ignore weather effects or certain rent fees.
  - Totoro Tree Access: Need 10 tokens to approach Totoro’s Tree and fulfill the final condition for winning.
  - Pay Forest Management Fees (Taxes): Players can choose to pay taxes in tokens instead of coins, offering an alternative that preserves their wealth.

## 3. Bus Stops and Weather Effects

- Bus Stops:
  - Players can buy Bus Stops to earn “transport fees” when other players land on them (similar to railroads). Owning multiple Bus Stops increases fees.
  - Transport Fee: Players landing on a Bus Stop must pay a transport fee to the owner:
    - 1 stop owned: Pay 25 coins.
    - 2 stops owned: Pay 50 coins.
    - 3 stops owned: Pay 100 coins.
    - 4 stops owned: Pay 200 coins.
  - Owners of all 4 Bus Stops can use the Catbus for free during their turn, bypassing the regular transport fee.
- Catbus Travel:
  - Players can summon the Catbus by spending 2 forest tokens.
  - The Catbus allows you to travel to any Bus Stop or the Totoro tree (if you claim you want to win through the forest token goal).
  - You can use catbus travel to escape from fine.
- Weather Effects:
  - Weather changes every 3 turns (tracked using a small token on the board).
  - Rainy Weather:
    - ~~Rent on Bus Stops doubles. Too powerful~~
    - Catbus becomes unavailable for travel.
  - Sunny Weather:
    - Normal gameplay; Catbus operates as usual.

## 4. Dust Sprite Activities

- Dust Sprite Spaces:
  - Draw a Special Dust Sprite Card
  - Alternatively, they can trade coins for tokens at a favorable exchange rate (e.g., 25 coins = 1 token).

## 5. Utilities

- "Dust Sprite Coal Delivery" Cost: 150 coins.
  - If a "not owner" lands here they can either:
    1. Pay the rent (4x or 10x dice roll if both utilities are owned).
    2. Trade one Forest Token (if they have any) to avoid paying rent, gaining favor with the Dust Sprites. (50:1 ratio)
        - If this trade is done, the owner receives 1 Forest Token per forest token trade (one-time for one place & person bonus), alternatively the owner earns 20 coins per natural property they own (one-time for one place & person bonus). Example: If the owner has 3 natural properties, they earn 60 coins per token traded.
        - it means if one day the owner sells it, another player who buys it can again get this bonus.
  - Punishment Interaction:
    - During Rainy Weather, landing on this utility results in an extra 10% rent, at least 10, due to slippery coal paths.

## 6. Final Winning Condition

There are two possible victory conditions:

### 1. Forest Tokens Goal

To win, players must reach Totoro’s Tree by fulfilling one of two paths:

- a) The Hidden Path
  - Requirements
    - Collect 10 Forest Tokens.
    - Obtain the “Dust Sprite’s Help” card
  - Steps
    - Once you have 10 tokens and the “Dust Sprite’s Help” card, announce you’re aiming for Totoro’s Tree.
    - After declaring:
      - You cannot buy properties or collect tokens intentionally (e.g., trading, purchasing).
      - You can still gain tokens by:
        - Landing on Natural Places.
        - Drawing Chance Cards that grant tokens.
    - Journey to Totoro’s Tree:
      - You must land on Hidden Path first.
      - Move to Totoro’s Tree to win.
- b) The Catbus drive
  - Requirements
    - Collect 10 Forest Tokens.
    - Obtain the Umbrella Tool
  - Steps
    - Land on any Bus Stop and announce you’re "waiting for Big Totoro"
    - Move to Totoro’s tree to win.

Interruption Rules (Shared for Both Paths) \
Players can disrupt a declared victory attempt in two ways:

  1. Steal Tokens:
      - If a claimant is on the Forest Tokens Path, opponents can steal 1 token by landing on their properties.
      - If the claimant drops below 10 tokens, they must recover to 10 before reaching Totoro’s Tree.
  2. Block the Tree:
      - If any player reaches Totoro’s Tree before the claimant, the claimant’s attempt fails:
          - Forest Tokens Path: Lose 2 tokens and restart.
  3. Sabotage Declarations:
      - Opponents can use cards to cancel a declaration (e.g., “Rainstorm” cancels the Umbrella attempt).

### 2. Traditional Wealth Goal

If one player bankrupts all others, they win as in classic Monopoly.
