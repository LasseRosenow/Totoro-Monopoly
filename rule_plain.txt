Starting
Every person gets 1000 coins and 2 forest tokens.
Every time a player passes the starting point, they can get 200 coins and 1 forest token.
1. Natural vs. Non-Natural Places
•	Natural Places:
o	Owning these places gives you forest tokens when certain conditions are met (e.g., landing on them, passing through, or drawing a relevant card).
o	No building allowed: These locations remain pure, in line with their natural theme.
o	Rewards: Each natural place can grant 1 forest token when landed on by other players. Or (50 coins, 100 coins, 150 coins, 200 coins according to the side).
o	Players earn a Forest Token only when stepping on owned natural places, not when they purchase one.
•	Non-Natural Places:
o	Work like traditional Monopoly properties. Players can build houses (or thematic alternatives like cabins) on these locations to collect rent.
o	Players need to own all spaces in the same label (natural vs. non-natural) group to build (similar to traditional rules)
o	Goal: These places represent community structures, so they are associated with earning money rather than forest tokens.

2. Forest Tokens
•	Purpose: An alternative currency used for special actions like summoning the Catbus, avoiding penalties, or advancing toward victory.
•	Earning Forest Tokens:
o	Landing on natural places (owned or unowned) grants 1 token.
•  When another player lands on a natural place that you own, you gain 1 forest token (instead of rent).
•  If the space is unowned, the player earns 1 forest token directly.
o	Completing certain challenges or drawing specific cards rewards tokens.
o	Trading money for tokens is allowed. To prevent exploitation, no reverse exchange (tokens back to coins) is allowed.
•	Using Forest Tokens:
o	Summon the Catbus: Spend 2 tokens to teleport to any Bus Stop.
o	Avoid penalties: Pay 1 token to ignore weather effects or certain rent fees.
o	Totoro Tree Access: Need 10 tokens to approach Totoro’s Tree and fulfill the final condition for winning.
o	Pay Forest Management Fees (Taxes): Players can choose to pay taxes in tokens instead of coins, offering an alternative that preserves their wealth.

3. Bus Stops and Weather Effects
•	Bus Stops:
o	Players can buy Bus Stops to earn “transport fees” when other players land on them (similar to railroads). Owning multiple Bus Stops increases fees.
o	Transport Fee: Players landing on a Bus Stop must pay a transport fee to the owner:
	1 stop owned: Pay 25 coins.
	2 stops owned: Pay 50 coins.
	3 stops owned: Pay 100 coins.
	4 stops owned: Pay 200 coins.
o	Owners of all 4 Bus Stops can use the Catbus for free during their turn, bypassing the regular transport fee.
•	Catbus Travel:
o	Players can summon the Catbus by spending 2 forest tokens.
o	The Catbus allows you to travel to any Bus Stop or the Totoro tree (if you claim you want to win through the forest token goal).
o	You can use catbus travel to escape from fine.
•	Weather Effects:
o	Weather changes every 3 turns (tracked using a small token on the board).
o	Rainy Weather:
	Rent on Bus Stops doubles. Too powerful
	Catbus becomes unavailable for travel.
o	Sunny Weather:
	Normal gameplay; Catbus operates as usual.

4. Dust Sprite Activities
•	Dust Sprite Spaces:
o	Draw a Special Dust Sprite Card 
o	Alternatively, they can trade coins for tokens at a favorable exchange rate (e.g., 25 coins = 1 token).

5. Utilities
"Dust Sprite Coal Delivery" Cost: 150 coins.
o	Not owner lands here can either :
	Pay the rent (4x or 10x dice roll if both utilities are owned).
	Trade one Forest Token (if they have any) to avoid paying rent, gaining favor with the Soot Sprites. (50: 1 ratio)
	If this trade is done, the owner receives 1 Forest Token per forest token trade (one-time for one place & person bonus), alternatively. the owner earns 20 coins per natural property they own (one-time for one place & person bonus). Example: If the owner has 3 natural properties, they earn 60 coins per token traded.
	it means if one day the owner sells, other person who buys it van again get this bonus.
o	Punishment Interaction:
	During Rainy Weather, landing on this utility results in an extra 10% rent, at least 10, due to slippery coal paths.

	Landing on Natural Places.

Interruption Rules (Shared for Both Paths)
Players can disrupt a declared victory attempt in two ways:
1.	Steal Tokens:
o	If a claimant is on the Forest Tokens Path, opponents can steal 1 token by landing on their properties.
o	If the claimant drops below 10 tokens, they must recover to 10 before reaching Totoro’s Tree.
2.	Block the Tree:
o	If any player reaches Totoro’s Tree before the claimant, the claimant’s attempt fails:
	Forest Tokens Path: Lose 2 tokens and restart.
3.	Sabotage Declarations:
o	Opponents can use cards to cancel a declaration (e.g., “Rainstorm” cancels the Umbrella attempt).

2. Traditional Wealth Goal: If one player bankrupts all others, they win as in classic Monopoly.
